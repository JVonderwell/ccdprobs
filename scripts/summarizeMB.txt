Here is another data set with 4 taxa we can try. It also has a shorter
middle branch length. The fixed parameters are at the bottom of the
.nex file. The .out file contains a summary of the tree topology
probabilities and the mean and middle 95%-iles of all the branch
lengths, by topology and combined.

I also create a file I name mb.sed that has just this line.

s/\[&U\]//g;

I use this to eliminate the text [&U] that appears in the MrBayes 3.2
.t files. I should just fix the mb2badger program.

So, here is an example work flow.

mb birds4.nex     // this creates birds4.nex.t and other files
sed -f mb.sed birds4.nex.t > birds4.t
mb2badger birds4.t
summarize -s 1001 birds4.tre

In R, I then read in the birds4.top file as a data frame and the .tre
file using read.tree() form ape. A lot of messing around gave me the
branch length summaries in the .out file.

That type of summary we will want to generalize for trees of arbitrary
size so that we can easily compare MrBayes MCMC output with the
Importance Sampling output, but for now is okay. Let's see if we can
tinker with the branch length generation software until we get samples
where the weights are much more evenly spread out for both of these
data sets.

The birds data set is selected from a larger data set with 10 taxa
that would be good to work with when we expand to larger trees as
there is a lot of topological uncertainty and small internal edges.
