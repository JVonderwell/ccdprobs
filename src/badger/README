These files are from BADGER and can be used to summarize tree files. I
think `make summarize' should work to compile.

The code mb2badger.C can take input from *.t MrBayes files to create a
.top and a .tre file with .top containing topologies in canonical
order and .tre the same for trees with branch lengths.
