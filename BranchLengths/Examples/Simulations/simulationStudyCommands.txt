- Instructions after run:
1) rename weights, trees, and blOneRep.txt based on fromto and nice/ugly bl
2) remove out, fasta, par2D/3D files (except of mac), make clean
3) check git status in each computer, and do git add, git commit (should be on different files)
4) also do git pull
5) after merging, do git push in all computers
6) do git pull in my mac, should have all weights files
7) move weights, trees, blOneRep.txt, logw files to Examples/Simulations/simulations1
9) run plotWeights.r, modify code to read all weights and merge data, create plot for nice/ugly bl


======= simulations1===================
30 replicates for nice bl, 12 replicates for ugly bl
using cats-dogs data, and subsets for ntaxa=3,4,...,12
for nice bl: all bl 0.15; for ugly bl, depending on subset taxa
using: blOneRep.pl and blAllReps.pl
summarizing with plotWeights.r: ess% and time.
using mvnormal.
out and fasta files from last run in mac: ntax=12, rep=10

* mac daniel 6/9 10am: nice bl
perl blAllReps.pl -from 1 -to 10
expected finished 10pm
(settings?.txt changed to settings-?.txt to avoid name conflict, also
the logw files with "o" at the end; all because I made the mistakae of
starting replicates 1-10 in two places)

* 6/9 12pm: nice branches
darwin00:
1) compile bl for darwin.
2) check that ape is installed in R: yes

expected to finish in 4 hours: 6/9 4pm
but this can take longer because ugly bl are harder
** killed on 6/13 because it got stuck in ntaxa=5
** CladeDist5 was deleted when trying to push
** will push CladeDist6
