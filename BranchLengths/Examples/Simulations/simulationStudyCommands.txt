======= simulations1===================
30 replicates for nice bl, 12 replicates for ugly bl
using cats-dogs data, and subsets for ntaxa=3,4,...,12
for nice bl: all bl 0.15; for ugly bl, depending on subset taxa
using: blOneRep.pl and blAllReps.pl
summarizing with plotWeights.r: ess% and time.
using mvnormal.
out and fasta files from last run in mac: ntax=12

* mac daniel 6/9 10am: nice bl
perl blAllReps.pl -from 1 -to 10
expected finished 10pm
(settings?.txt changed to settings-?.txt to avoid name conflict, also
the logw files with "o" at the end; all because I made the mistakae of
starting replicates 1-10 in two places)

* 6/9 12pm: nice branches
darwin00:
1) compile bl for darwin.
2) check that ape is installed in R: yes

expected to finish in 4 hours: 6/9 4pm
but this can take longer because ugly bl are harder
