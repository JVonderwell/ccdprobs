*** 4 taxa:
* mvnormal behaving much better than gammabeta (20% vs 1%), not sure why



****for more than 4 taxa:
* save individual seed per run with error to replicate errors
* try/catch not working: need to change exit(1) to throw(...), maybe
* we want different types of errors
Bret:
- set seed per replicate how? create vector of seeds?
- different types of errors? with nice error msg that we can see and
* control, and distinguish

-------
To do (later):
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
- still need checks for t==sum in mleDistance?D, when to set it ==sum?
- still need to check slightly better ESS in R for gammabeta than in
C++. for example, in 4 taxa simulated data: R 36%, C++ 30%.
for mvnormal it is different also, R: 40%, c++ 45%.

--------
later:
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
