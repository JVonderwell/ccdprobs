To do:

- sum smaller than summand in partialPathCalculations2D:
  prop = curr+delta, and now it is bigger than sum

- birds4: still sum<summand, and should not happen: need restricted NR
  usually we need maximum (MLE): mu1,mu2. But now we need maximum
  restricted to mu1<sum. what to do? make mu1=sum?
  mu1=sum does not work, close to sum like 90% we can try.
  or adding a exp prior.

- when we get a negative bl at the beginning, the sum no longer adds
  up; we need a better starting point not relying on NJ

- recurse=true and false are giving different gradient in partialPathCalc2D

** recurse=true fixes everything on birds4! need to add calculate on
   the parent after setting the bl


- should add a check for gradient close to zero in 2D, 3D. for the
 birds case, we start with a curr with gradient very close to zero,
 and we keep searching! (done, need to discuss with bret)

- need to develop algorithm for a
  internal node, to find a leaf, and do mleDistance on two leaves,
  keeping track of length to substract at the end

- nan problem: seems to be the starting point for the mle search (for
  two sequences), specially when one is internal node: so problem, how
  to find starting point for mle search. we are getting mle distance
  between each 2 sequences (out of 3).
  we can check besides the dlogl for curr=0.05, but also the logl.
  curr_dlogl>0, then we double prop=2*curr, and if prop_dlogl is still
  >0, but prop_logl is not bigger than curr_logl, we are going in the
  wrong direction (we don't trust the derivative).
  maybe choose two starting point? instead of only 0.05

  problem: the picture does not add up. it seems that it is not
  unimodal because the derivative at 0.05 should be negative
  otherwise. should we plot it?
  start with two points and make sure that logl and dlogl are
  consistent to what we believe


--------
bret:
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile


---------
To do after:

- double check theory of gamma/beta (correct exp, var,cov) and
  doublecheck code
- check if after fixing starting point, we still get sum<summand in
  partialPathCalc2D
