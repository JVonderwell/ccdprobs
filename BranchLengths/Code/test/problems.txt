To do:
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
- still need checks for t==sum in mleDistance?D, when to set it ==sum?

- weights in a vector: check 4taxa case, compare to R:
* find a way to write the logweights to file
* put sample size as argument
* find simulated data where everything worked, and test this
* find birds/cats data for 4 taxa and test. recall that we did not
have a good ess in R on these examples, we suspected because the
normal was not good fit when bl~0.
* save individual seed per run with error to replicate errors



--------
bret (later):
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,

- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
