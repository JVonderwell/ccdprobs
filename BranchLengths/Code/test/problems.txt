** also found in partialPathCal1D!! record this.

- finish logdensity new attribute in tree, and check that it works,
  maybe not because it is private attribute, maybe we need to do in
  two steps


----
Bret:
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,
first weights:
- need to calculate as we go, not all at the end, where to keep it?
attribute in tree to do dens += whatever?


--------
bret:
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
