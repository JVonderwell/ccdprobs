To do:
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
- still need checks for t==sum in mleDistance?D, when to set it ==sum?

----
Bret:
 - weights done
 - check pathological cases: for beta, problem! does not do anything, gets stuck!

pathological cases:
- 3D gamma: problem when mu1==0, mu2+L21z1<=0, m3+L31z1+L32z2<=0; 2D
mu1==0 or mu1==sum, mu3+L21z1<=0; 1D mu1==0 or mu1==s

- also, should we check for close to 0? or only exactly 0? close to
  zero causes problems also: changed to close to 0
  but this does not fix things, alpha and beta can still be negative
  with these fixes: mu(sum-mu) < sigma2 case, we control it with
  mu==0,sum, but it could also come from big sigma? only seen now with
  mu~0.

--------
bret (later):
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,

- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
