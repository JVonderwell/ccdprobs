To do:


** solution: need another derivation. we want to set the curr = 0 if it
   is close to zero and gradient still negative, and we want to keep
   optimizing for the other one, and not what we have now where we keep wanting to change the 0
(change to multinormal case while fixing this new N-R)

** need to do this for mleDistance3D also?
** do for 3D and 1D also


** beta: if mu=0, then set alpha=1, if mu=sum, then set beta=1, and figure out the other parameter depending on the variance.



----
Bret:
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,
first weights:
- need to calculate as we go, not all at the end, where to keep it?
attribute in tree to do dens += whatever?

bret:
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
