*** 4 taxa:
* simulated data 4 taxa: we get ESS 15% (both R and C++), hard to
* compare logdensity because we would need to know the order of
* sampled. but, it seems that bl have a wider range from c++ than R, why?

* find birds/cats data for 4 taxa and test. recall that we did not
have a good ess in R on these examples, we suspected because the
normal was not good fit when bl~0. rerun in R to compare dist of
weights


****for more than 4 taxa:
* save individual seed per run with error to replicate errors
* try/catch not working: need to change exit(1) to throw(...)
Bret:
- set seed per replicate how? create vector of seeds?
- how to save bl? not always in the same order: although for 4 birds
it looks in the same order

-------
To do (later):
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
- still need checks for t==sum in mleDistance?D, when to set it ==sum?

--------
later:
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
