- cov matrix is negative, does not make sense:
./bl -f "../../Data/cats-dogs.fasta" -t "((1,2),((6,3),(5,4)),((12,11),(((7,8),9),10)));" -p 0.267,0.2347,0.1817,0.3166 -q 0.008687964,0.451897075,0.012421873,0.002237899,0.487459670,0.037295519

- very big bl in prop 2D, 1D: ~100.

- cov negative and nan even in simulated data and birds



To do:
- modify 2D and 1D similar to mleDistance3D
