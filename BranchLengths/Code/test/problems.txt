To do:
- weights in a vector: check 4taxa case, compare to R:
1) write loglik and gamma parameters to file: compare plots in R
2) implement gamma/beta in R, see if it works

* go back to normal dist to see if it works on 4 taxa: compare weights
and logdens,loglik in c++



* find birds/cats data for 4 taxa and test. recall that we did not
have a good ess in R on these examples, we suspected because the
normal was not good fit when bl~0. rerun in R to compare dist of
weights

- for more than 4 taxa:
* save individual seed per run with error to replicate errors
* try/catch not working: need to change exit(1) to throw(...)

Bret:
- 4taxa birds: weights too big! imposible to get exp(.), problem logdensity huge, why?
- set seed per replicate how? create vector of seeds?
- how to save bl? not always in the same order: although for 4 birds
it looks in the same order

-------
To do (later):
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
- still need checks for t==sum in mleDistance?D, when to set it ==sum?

--------
bret (later):
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,

- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
