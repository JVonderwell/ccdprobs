- cov matrix is negative, does not make sense:
./bl -f "../../Data/cats-dogs.fasta" -t
"((1,2),((6,3),(5,4)),((12,11),(((7,8),9),10)));" -p
0.267,0.2347,0.1817,0.3166 -q
0.008687964,0.451897075,0.012421873,0.002237899,0.487459670,0.037295519


- very big bl in prop 2D, 1D: ~100.


To do:
- put things in functions to make code nicer
- run simulation examples to see if we have the same two issues
- add protective newton raphson to avoid going far off
