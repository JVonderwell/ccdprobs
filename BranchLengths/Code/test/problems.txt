To do:
- modify 2D and 1D similar to mleDistance3D (creo q ya hice esto)
- sum smaller than summand in partialPathCalculations2D: 
  prop = curr+delta, and now it is bigger than sum		 



- nan problem: seems to be the starting point for the mle search (for
  two sequences), specially when one is internal node: so problem, how
  to find starting point for mle search. we are getting mle distance
  between each 2 sequences (out of 3).
  we can check besides the dlogl for curr=0.05, but also the logl.
  curr_dlogl>0, then we double prop=2*curr, and if prop_dlogl is still
  >0, but prop_logl is not bigger than curr_logl, we are going in the
  wrong direction (we don't trust the derivative).
  maybe choose two starting point? instead of only 0.05

  problem: the picture does not add up. it seems that it is not
  unimodal because the derivative at 0.05 should be negative
  otherwise. should we plot it?
  start with two points and make sure that logl and dlogl are
  consistent to what we believe



---------
To do after:

- figure out how to generate beta, and modify code
- double check theory of gamma/beta (correct exp, var,cov) and
- doublecheck code
