To do:
- problems with beta 1D, not respecting the limits with the two sums
- need to double check the theory:
1D mean: 0.00978933, variance: 1.92673e-06
sum1, sum2 0.0162055, 0.210062
Sample 1D bl: 0.469128
Sampled negative branches in mleDistance1D
** why sampled so far from mean??

- in newton-raphson, proposing jump too big and mu1>sum:
entered while
mleDistance2D Newton-Raphson curr: 0.0271119  0.194765
mleDistance2D Newton-Raphson gradient: -9125.76 -775.194
mleDistance2D Newton-Raphson inverse hessian: 
2.5455e-06 0.00031892
0.00031892  0.0230049
New proposed: 0.297566  20.9384
with sum: 0.0421828
Sum smaller than summand in partialPathCalculations2D
t: 0.297566  20.9384
sum: 0.0421828



----
Bret:
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false

bret:
- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
