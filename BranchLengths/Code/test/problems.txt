To do:
- check theory for gamma (correct mean, var and cov)
** beta: if mu=0, then set alpha=1, if mu=sum, then set beta=1, and
figure out the other parameter depending on the variance, also for gamma

----
Bret:
first weights:
- need to calculate logdensity as we go, not all at the end, where to keep it?
attribute in tree to do dens += whatever?

pathological cases:
- 3D gamma: problem when mu1==0, mu2+L21z1<=0, m3+L31z1+L32z2<=0; 2D
mu1==0 or mu1==sum, mu3+L21z1<=0; 1D mu1==0 or mu1==s


--------
bret (later):
- check calculate parent at the end of generateBL, it does not work,
we get nan again with recurse=true or false: will leave for later,

- cannot write to file: gridPlotFile/gridPlotScreen, did not compile
