ccdprobs is a program that takes as input the summary of a MrBayes .t file produced with mbsum from BUCKy
and calculates for each input tree the conditional clade probability distribution estimated tree probability.

COPYRIGHT:

INSTALLATION:

ccdprobs is written in ANSI C++. If you have GNU's g++ installed, you ought to be able to compile the code
from the terminal with the command:

  make

assuming that you are in the directory $CCDPROBS/src where $CCDPROBS is whereever you put the distribution on your local computer.
This command produces the programs

  ccdprobs
  distance
  mbsum

If these instructions are not detailed enough, please find a local expert or wait for a future version with more user-friendly help.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

Type

  ccdprobs --help

for detailed instructions.  A typical analysis begins using the mbsum program to summarize the output from a run of MrBayes.
The required arguments to ccdprobs follow the flags --out and --in.  The argument after --out is the root file name of multiple output files.
If you use --out example, then the output files example.out, example.log, example.smap, and example.tmap will all be created.

EXAMPLE:

  mbsum --skip 1001 --out example.in example.nex.run1.t
  ccdprobs --in example.in --out example
