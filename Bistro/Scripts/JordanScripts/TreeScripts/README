Parser and plotter for comparison of MB and bistro most likely trees

After running bistro and MB on the nexus and fasta files, I ran Parser
./Parser <bistroFile>.topCounts <bistroFile>.bistroSum
to parse out the bistro tree information

I then ran Badger on <mbFile>.nex.t followed by Summarize on <mbFile>.nex.top
to get what I called <mbFile>.mbSum by personal convention

I then opened TreePlotter in RStudio, entered in <bistroFile>.bistroSum and <mbFile>.mbSum in for variables bistroFile and mbFile, and simply ran the script which gives a plot as output

I'm certain there are cleaner and more efficient ways to do this, but this system worked simply enough and I never had any runtime issues so it gets the job done.

Any questions, I'm best reached at:
