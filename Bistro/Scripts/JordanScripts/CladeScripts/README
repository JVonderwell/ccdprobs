Parser and Plotter for analysis of common clades from output of both bistro and mb

After running bistro and mb on .nexus and .fasta files, I ran bistroCladeParser and mbCladeParser which pulls the information from their outputs
./bistroCladeParser <bistroFile>-nopars.smap <bistroFile>.bistroClades
./mbCladeParser <mbFile>.nex.pars <mbFile>.nex.tstat <mbFile>.nex.mbClades

Note: this requires bistros clades to be represented in star and dot format like mister bayes. My version of ccdprobs is set to do this, but note if using other versions.

I then used those filenames as bistroFile and mbFile in CladePlotter.R and the plot is output. Pretty simple procedure.

Again, I'm certain there are better ways to do this, but this got the job done for me.

Any questions, I'm best reached at:
