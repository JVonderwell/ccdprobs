After running bistro, we have output files:

*** root.topPP = weighted probability for each sampled topology
    can be readily compared to mrbayes.trprobs

*** root.splits = weighted probability for each non-trivial split
    can be readily compared to mrbayes.tstat and mrbayes.parts

*** root---*.treeBL = trees with branch lengths
    need to change the rootnames of files in "summarizeBL.jl", and run in julia with
```julia
include("summarizeBL.jl")
```
    then we can compare mrbayes.vstat and bistro.vstat

*** root---*.out = table with topology, logl, logTop, logPrior, logBL, logQ, logWt, pi and s
    need to change the rootname in "summarizeOut.r" and run in R with
```R
source("../../Scripts/summarizeOut.r")
```
    need to be in the folder with the bistro output files
    then we can compare mrbayes.pstat and bistro.pstat

*** plots: readBistro.r can provide insightful plots
